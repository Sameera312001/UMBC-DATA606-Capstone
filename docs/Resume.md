## PROJECTS

- [**Earthquake Analysis 1900 - 2014**](https://github.com/Sameera312001/Earthquake-Analysis-1900-2014)
  - **Tool used:** Tableau
  - **Description:** Earthquake Analysis 1900 - 2014" dives into 8,313 temblors across 114 years. The dashboard exposes hotspots like Chile, Japan, and Peru, with peak activity buzzing in March - May. Average depths reached 76 km, magnitudes hovering around 4.26. From maps to scatter plots, dive deeper to uncover patterns and risks within this vast quake data treasure trove.

- [**Breast cancer Detection**](https://github.com/Sameera312001/Breast-cancer-Detection)
  - **Tool Used:** Python (Deep-Learning)
  - Description:** Project includes data loading, preprocessing, and the construction of a machine learning model using the Keras library. The model creation involves the sequential model, dense layers with activation functions, and optimizer specification. Overall, it provides a comprehensive overview of the data processing and model building steps for breast cancer detection.

- [**Stock Price Forcasting Using ARIMA Model**](https://github.com/Sameera312001/Stock-Price-Forcasting-using-ARIMA-Model)
  - **Tool Used:** Python (Financial Data Science)
  - **Description:** Built a Python program for stock price forecasting using ARIMA models. Analyzing trends, seasonality, and statistics, it auto-selects the optimal model for each stock. By comparing predictions with real prices, it provides actionable insights for informed investment decisions. This project highlights my expertise in data analysis, time series forecasting, and algorithmic modeling, empowering me to navigate financial markets with data-driven precision.
