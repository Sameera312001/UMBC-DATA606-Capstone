# Background
- **What is Telecom Customer Churn Prediction is about?**
  - Customer churn is defined as when customers discontinue services from a firm.
  - In this competitive businessess telecommunications have a churn rate of 15-25%.
  - For a telecom company to successfully expand its territory and retain customers, it needs to prioritize understanding individual customers and building their loyalty. This is because customers are the core element of success in this competitive market.
  - The dataset contains information on 7,043 customers of a telecommunications company.
  - Each customer has 21 attributes describing their demographics, service usage, and billing information.
  - The target variable is "Churn," indicating whether a customer left the company within the last month (Yes/No).
- **Why does it matter?**
  - Customer churn is a significant challenge for telecom companies, as it can lead to lost revenue, decreased profitability, and damage to the company's reputation. 
  - Studies have shown that acquiring new customers can be five to seven times more expensive than retaining existing ones. 
  - Therefore, it is crucial for telecom companies to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to prevent it.
