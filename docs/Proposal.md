# Background
- What is Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis is about?
 - "Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis" covers data from 1900 to 2021 for 194 countries, including various aspects of energy consumption like solar, wind, hydro, and fossil fuels. This allows for a vast scope of analysis possibilities like :
   - Which countries have the highest renewable energy consumption?
   - Among the top consumers, which countries rely more heavily on clean energy sources?
   - What is the contribution of solar energy to the total renewable energy consumption?
   - How has the consumption of solar, wind, and hydropower changed over the past decade?
   - Is there a correlation between the development of clean energy and fossil fuel consumption?
