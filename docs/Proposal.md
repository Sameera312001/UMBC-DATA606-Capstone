# Background
- **What is Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis is about?**
  - "Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis" covers data from 1900 to 2021 for 194 countries, including various aspects of energy consumption like solar, wind, hydro, and fossil fuels. This allows for a vast scope of analysis possibilities like :
    - Which countries have the highest renewable energy consumption?
    - Among the top consumers, which countries rely more heavily on clean energy sources?
    - What is the contribution of solar energy to the total renewable energy consumption?
    - How has the consumption of solar, wind, and hydropower changed over the past decade?
    - Is there a correlation between the development of clean energy and fossil fuel consumption?
- **Why does it matter?**
  - The project on renewable energy consumption matters for several reasons:
    - Environmental Impact: Fossil fuels, the traditional energy source, release greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Analyzing renewable energy consumption helps us understand how effectively we're transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, mitigating climate change's devastating impacts.
    - Sustainability: Fossil fuels are finite resources, and their depletion poses a long-term concern. Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are naturally replenished, ensuring a sustainable energy future for generations to come.
    - Economic Development: Investing in renewable energy creates new jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, boosting economies and diversifying energy sectors. Understanding consumption patterns helps assess economic potential and guide investments.
    - Energy Security: Reliance on imported fossil fuels creates vulnerabilities to price fluctuations and geopolitical situations. By analyzing renewable energy consumption, we can assess progress towards energy independence and national security.
    - Public Health: Fossil fuel use contributes to air pollution, causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems. Renewable energy sources offer cleaner alternatives, improving public health and well-being.
    - Knowledge & Advocacy: This project contributes valuable knowledge to the ongoing conversation about energy transition. By understanding consumption patterns, researchers, policymakers, and advocates can make informed decisions and promote wider adoption of renewable energy.
  - Therefore, analyzing renewable energy consumption isn't just about numbers; it's about understanding our progress towards a more sustainable, climate-friendly, and secure future for all.
- **What are your research questions?**
  - As mentioned in question 1, my research questions are:
    - Which countries have the highest renewable energy consumption?
    - Among the top consumers, which countries rely more heavily on clean energy sources?
    - What is the contribution of solar energy to the total renewable energy consumption?
    - How has the consumption of solar, wind, and hydropower changed over the past decade?
    - Is there a correlation between the development of clean energy and fossil fuel consumption?
